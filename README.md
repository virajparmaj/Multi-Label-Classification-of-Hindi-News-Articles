# Multi-Label Classification of Hindi News Articles
_A machine learning system for empowering local Hindi news organizations_

---

## üìå Overview
### Problem Statement
Local news organizations in India, especially those serving vernacular audiences, face budget constraints that limit their ability to adopt modern data tools. With ~98% of rural and 1/3 of urban Indians preferring Hindi content, bridging the Hindi‚ÄìEnglish digital divide is critical.

This project builds a **multi-label text classifier** for Hindi e-news articles, enabling automated tagging into **14 categories**. The system empowers newsrooms, editors, and readers with faster curation, improved accessibility, and cost-effective AI adoption.

### Motivation
- Support regional journalism and preserve linguistic diversity.  
- Provide vernacular readers with more accurate, timely, and categorized content.  
- Enable targeted advertising and insights into content trends.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Custom Hindi dataset** scraped from online news portals.  
- **Multi-label classification** across 14 categories.  
- **TF-IDF feature extraction** with scikit-learn pipelines.  
- **Binary Relevance baseline** achieving ~43% accuracy.  
- **Lightweight and reproducible codebase** for academic and industrial extension.
